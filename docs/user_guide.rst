User Guide
==========

This user guide is example based, and should give you an idea how to accomplish common tasks.

Information on specific methods and classes can be found in the API Reference.

There are a few tutorials available as `Jupyter Notebooks <https://github.com/Deltares/hatyan/blob/main/docs/notebooks>`_. You can `Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Deltares/hatyan/HEAD?urlpath=/tree/docs/notebooks>`_ to run these notebooks interactively (loading can take a while). There are also `example scripts <https://github.com/Deltares/hatyan/tree/main/tests/examples>`_ available with more specific applications. Two of these basic notebooks/examples are embedded here.
